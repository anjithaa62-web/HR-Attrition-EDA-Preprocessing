# HR Employee Attrition – EDA & Data Preprocessing

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing on the HR Employee Attrition dataset.  
The goal is to prepare the dataset for machine learning by handling outliers, encoding categorical variables, and applying feature scaling.

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and basic exploration
- Missing value detection
- Outlier detection using boxplots
- Outlier treatment using IQR method
- Encoding categorical variables (Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding)
- Feature scaling (Min-Max Scaling & Standardization)
- Visualization before and after scaling

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
The dataset was successfully cleaned and preprocessed.  
All features are now numerical and properly scaled, making the data suitable for machine learning models.
